MIPanalyzer
------------

`MIPanalyzer` is a tool for analyzing MIP (molecular inversion probe) data. It performs the following functions:

- Reading in raw data, usually in the form of a `vcf` file produced by [MIPwrangler](https://github.com/bailey-lab/MIPWrangler)
- Filtering samples and loci based on coverage, missingness, and other metrics
- Performing simple population genetic analyses, such as PCA and basic pairwise distance metrics

All documentation, including installation instructions and tutorials, are on [the MIPanalyzer website](https://mrc-ide.github.io/MIPanalyzer).


Version History
