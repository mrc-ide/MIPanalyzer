# MIPanalyzer

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrc-ide/MIPanalyzer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrc-ide/MIPanalyzer)


## Motivation

`MIPanalyzer` is a tool for analyzing MIPs (molecular inversion probe) data. This will usually be in the form of `vcf` files produced by [MIPwrangler](https://github.com/bailey-lab/MIPWrangler).

## Installation

You can also install `MIPanalyzer` from github with:

```{r gh_installation, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mrc-ide/MIPanalyzer")
```

Note that on Windows, a toolkit (Rtools) needs to be installed separately for devtools to work. 

Once installed, the package can be loaded using:

```{r}
# Load the package
library(MIPanalyzer)
```
