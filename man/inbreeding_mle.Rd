\title{Estimate pairwise inbreeding coefficient F by maximum likelihood}
\usage{
inbreeding_mle(
  x,
  f = seq(0, 1, l = 11),
  ignore_het = FALSE,
  report_progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class \code{mipanalyzer_biallelic}.}

\item{f}{values of f that are explored.}

\item{ignore_het}{whether to ignore heterzygous comparisons, or alternatively
call the major allele at every locus (see details).}

\item{report_progress}{if \code{TRUE} then a progress bar is printed to the
console.}
}
\description{
Estimates the inbreeding coefficient between all pairs of
  samples by maximum likelihood.
}
\details{
The probability of seeing the same or different alleles at a locus
  can be written in terms of the global allele frequency p and the inbreeding
  coefficient f, for example the probability of seeing the same REF allele is
  \eqn{(1-f)*p^2 + f*p}. This formula can be multiplied over all loci to
  arrive at the overall likelihood of each value of f, which can then be
  chosen by maximum likelihood. This function carries out this comparison
  between all pairwise samples, passed in as a matrix. The formula above only
  applies when comparing homozygous calls - for homo/het or het/het
  comparisons we can either ignore these loci (the default) or convert hets
  to homo by calling the major allele at every locus.
